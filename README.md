# SklearnGUI - Machine Learning Model Builder

SklearnGUI is a user-friendly desktop application that allows you to build, train, and evaluate machine learning models without writing code. It provides an intuitive interface for data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation.

## Installation

You can install and run SklearnGUI on any system with Python 3.6 or newer. No pre-built executable is needed-just follow these steps:

### 1. Download the Source Code

- Clone the GitHub repository or download and extract the source code ZIP.

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

A virtual environment keeps your projectâ€™s dependencies isolated from other Python projects on your system.

- **Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.**
- Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `.venv`:

  ```bash
  python -m venv SklearnGUIENV
  ```

- **Activate the virtual environment:**

  - On **Windows**:
    ```bash
    SklearnGUIENV\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - On **macOS/Linux**:
    ```bash
    source SklearnGUIENV/bin/activate
    ```
    
### 3. Install Required Libraries

- With the virtual environment activated, install all dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

  This will install all necessary packages in bulk[2].

### 4. Run the Application

- Start SklearnGUI with:

  ```bash
  python3 SklearnGUI.py
  ```
